  Which eight bus stops have the smallest population above 500 people
  inside of Philadelphia within 800 meters of the stop (Philadelphia
  county block groups have a geoid prefix of 42101 -- that's 42 for
  the state of PA, and 101 for Philadelphia county)?

  The queries to #1 & #2 should generate results with a single row,
  with the following structure:

  (
    stop_id text, -- The ID of the station
    stop_name text, -- The name of the station
    estimated_pop_800m integer -- The population within 800 meters
